The `lifecycle` block in Terraform is used to manage specific behaviors of resources, such as preventing updates, replacing resources instead of updating them, or ignoring changes to certain attributes. The `ignore_changes` argument within the `lifecycle` block allows you to specify a list of resource attributes that Terraform should ignore when it detects differences between the configuration and the real infrastructure.

### Some example you may use in AWS

```hcl
resource "aws_route53_zone" "you_zone" {

  tags = ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      tags["tag_to_ignore"]
    ]
  }
}
```
